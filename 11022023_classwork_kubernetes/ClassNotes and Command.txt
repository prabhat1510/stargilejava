minikube: a ONE Node cluster, where the master and worker processes are on the same machine. 
Kubectl, the command line tool for Kubernetes, then enables the interaction with the cluster: to create pods, services and other components.
By default, kubectl gets configured to access the kubernetes cluster control plane inside minikube when the minikube start command is executed.
